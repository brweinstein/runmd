### Intro to Racket
- Dialect of Scheme --> from LISP
- Based of mathematical ideas (lambda calculus)
- Pure functional language --> more math-like way 

### Prefix Notation
```racket
(+ 1 2) ; 1 + 2
```Ex. 6/2(1+2) = ?
- Is it 9 or 1?
- Racket simplifies PEMDAS by using brackets
- We can rewrite the above expression as (6/2) * (1+2)

The equivalent operation in racket is
```racket
(* (/ 6 2) (+ 1 2))
; we can evaluate as
(* 3 (+ 1 2))
(* 3 3)
;output is 9
```

```racket
(- (+ 9 (* (/ 6 (+ 1 1)) 3)) 2)
(- (+ 9 (* (/ 6 2) 3)) 2)
(- (+ 9 (* 3 3)) 2)
(- (+ 9 9) 2)
(- 18 2)
;output is 16
```

We can also use two or more values
```racket
(+ 11 12 13) ;36
(/ 720 5 4 3 2 1) ;6
```

Negation
```racket
(- 144) ;-144
(- -21) ;21
(+ 72) ;ERROR (for beginner)
```### Sets of Numbers

Natural Numbers
- Natural Numbers are important in CS
- 0 is a natural number (rip m135)
- If n is a natural number, then n + 1 is a natural number.
- There is a debate on where natural number start
- In future notes, we will write 'nat' as set of natural numbers
- Likewise integers are int, rationals are rat

Exponentation
```racket
(expt 2 4); 2^4
(sqrt 2); i1.414...... i for inexact
```# Values and Expressions

Racket uses prefix notation (see sep3)

### Turning into a Racket Expr
Math: (8 + 2) * (6 - 4)
```racket
(* (+ 8 2) (- 6 4))
```Math: 8/(3 * (2 + 1))
```racket
(/ 8 (* 3 (+ 2 1)))
```### Quotient and Remainder
Integer division
```racket
(quotient 43 7); 6
```Remainder
```racket
(remainder 43 7); 1
```Exercise: Write a Racket expression to add the remainder when 17 is divided by 4, to the integer quotient when 17 is divided by 4.
```racket
(+ (quotient 17 4) (remainder 17 4))
```1. How many complete groups of 7 can you make from 60 students
```racket
(quotient 60 7); 8
```2. If you have 126 items and want to make packages of 8 items, how many items will be left over?
```racket
(remainder 126 8); 6
```### Types and Subtypes

`Nat`, `Int`, and `Rat` are types of numbers

Some operations (eg. remainder) are only valid on certain types

Since any `Nat` is also an `Int`. Any `Int` or `Nat` is also a `Rat`
- `Nat` is a subtype of `Int`
- `Int` and `Nat` are subtypes of `Rat`
- `Nat` \subset `Int` \subset `Rat`

### Max and Min Operators
```racket
(max 4 8 -9 3); 8
(min 4 8 -9 3); -9
```Write a Racket expression to find the area of a rectangle where the length is the larger of 6 and 4, and the width is the smaller of 8 and 5.
```racket
(* (max 6 4) (min 8 5)); 30
```### sqr and expt operations
```racket
(sqr 12); 144
(expt 3 4); 81 (3^4)
```Note: `(sqr n)` is equiv to `(expt n 2)` 

Write a racket expression to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8.
```racket
(sqrt (+ (sqr 6) (sqr 8))); 10 
```Alternative to `(sqrt n)` is `(expt n 1/2)`

The steps of this expression is:
```racket
(sqrt (+ (sqr 6) (sqr 8)))
(sqrt (+ 36 (sqr 8)))
(sqrt (+ 36 64))
(sqrt 100)
(10); simplest form
```If we changed to expression to
```racket
(sqrt (+ (sqr 4) (sqr 2)))

;Since the output is inexact

(sqr (sqrt (+ (sqr 4) (sqr 2)))); does not equal 16
```The output is `#i4.47213595499958`. The #i is for inexact

### Variable Constants
We say that define binds a value to a name
```racket
(define x 7)
(define y 11)
(+ (sqr x) (* 6 x y) (sqr y)); x^2 + 6xy + y^2
;evaluates x at 7, y at 11
```We could define a variable as an expression, above we could change
```racket
(define x (+ (* 2 2) 2 1))
;which steps to
(define x 7)
```- Names must be defined before they can be used
- Once defined, names cannot be overwritten
- Use constants and name them meaningfully

You're planning a pizza party! Define constants for the number of pizzas needed (8), cost per pizza ($12), number of drinks needed (15), and cost per dirnk ($3). Then write a racket expression to find the total cost of the party.
```racket
(define pizzas_needed 8)
(define cost_per_pizza 12)
(define drinks_needed 15)
(define cost_per_drink 3)
(+ (* cost_per_pizza pizzas_needed) (* cost_per_drink drinks_needed))
```Racket is stupid... you can do this
```racket
(define +-+ 3); this is valid
(define 2_ 3); this is also valid
```# Boolean Expressions

Consider the statement `x < 5`:
- In math, this is a open sentence
- In racket, this is an operator
```racket
(define x 10)
(< x 5); false
```The operators are
```racket
(define x 2)
(define y x)
(< x y)
(> x y)
(= x y)
(>= x y)
(<= x y)
```Each evaluates to either `true` or `false`

### Expressions with Boolean Values

Both `and` and `or` are boolean operators
- `and` is `true` when all arguments are `true`
- `or` is `true` when at least one of the arguments are `true`
- `not` is a negation operator, `T` --> `F`, `F` --> `T`

```racket
(and (or (< 2 3) (> 1 5)) (not (< 10 15)) (<= 5 5)); false
```### Short circuit evaluation
```racket
(define numer 50)
(define denom 4)

;; Write an expression that will be true if numer / denom is greater than 10
;; Never crash because of division by zero
(> numer (* denom 10)); cheese
;; or
(and (not (= denom 0)) (> (/ numer denom) 10)); avoids short circuit
```### De Morgans Laws
Useful for simplifying sometimes
- `(not (and A B))` is eqv. to `(or (not A) (not B))`
- `(not (or A B))` is eqv. to `(and (not A) (not B))`
